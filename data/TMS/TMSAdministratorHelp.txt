---++ Introduction

TMS administrators should begin by reading the TMSDesignDecisions document, followed by the TMSKnownIssues document.

---++ Setup and configuration

Administrators need to:

   1. Add a preference in !Main.SitePreferences specifying the name of the TMS web (which upon installation is 'TMS'). If you rename the TMS web (e.g. to 'Tasks'), this setting must be changed accordingly.
      <verbatim>Set TMSWEBNAME = TMS</verbatim>
   1. Add a preference in !Main.SitePreferences specifying a default set of tags available for TMS tasks. Each tag must consist of lower-case alphanumeric characters, with no in-tag spaces; tags must be separated by a comma, optionally followed by a space character. This can be left empty if no default set is required.
      <verbatim>Set TMSDEFAULTTAGS = </verbatim>
   1. Create a !WikiGroup called 'TMSUsersGroup'. Members of this group will be listed in the 'Lead' and 'Assistants' drop-downs on the Task Details page, so members need to be added accordingly.

A "public tasks" interface, suitable for including in non-Foswiki pages via e.g. an IFRAME HTML tag, is provided via the PublicTasksAvailable page. The style of this page can be customised via the PublicTasksAvailableCSS topic.

---++ General usage notes

Each 'task' is assigned its own topic page, with a title generated by Foswiki's AUTOINC numbering system. Consequently, deleting a task topic makes the task ID number available again for new tasks. Given the potential confusion that could result from this, task topic deletion functionality has not been made directly available to end-users. Instead, Foswiki administrators must visit the relevant task topic via e.g. WebTopicList and delete the topic via the standard Foswiki process.
