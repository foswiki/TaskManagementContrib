The following are known issues with [[%TMSWEBNAME%.TaskList][the Task Management System]]:

---++ Visual issues

   * On 'PublicTasksAvailable' page, selecting "More info" for a task display at the bottom of the browser window does not reposition the task so that all task particulars are visible.
   * Should be able to view a hierarchical tree of tasks, sub-tasks, sub-sub-tasks etc.

---++ Behavioural issues

   * Datepicker widget is occasionally not available on the 'Deadline' field on the Task Details page. Forcing the browser to refresh the page can fix the problem.
